The Weather:
1.	Solution Approach:
  1.1	Tools: Ubuntu 18.4, python 3+, Git hub
  1.2	 System: Windows 10 
  1.3	 Scope: The output of the weather data satisfies below boundary conditions:
      
    1.3.1: City driven: The output of the source data is BOM Australia and the output is driven by major Australian cities. So, the game players should play game from these cities only.  The content of the data only covers major Australian cities. I think if we can change the source to something which is latitude/longitude driven, we can drive the output through latitude/longitude.

    1.3.2: Reverse Calculation:  % humidity, air pressure, elevation has been back calculated with mathematical formula.
                1.4 Additional Scope: Installation of ubuntu on windows 10. python/pip/pylint installation
